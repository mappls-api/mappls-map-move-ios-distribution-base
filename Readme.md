# [Mappls Map SDK]()

## [Introduction]()

This repository contains a sample project of an app built for iOS, which is based on Mappls's Map and other differennt SDKs.

**Welcome to the Mappls iOS SDK**

Explore the largest directory of APIs & SDKs for maps, routes and search.

Mappls's APIs, SDKs, and live updating map data available for [238 nations](https://github.com/mappls-api/mapmyindia-rest-api/blob/master/docs/countryISO.md) give developers tools to build better mapping, navigation, and search experiences across platforms.

In this section you will find documentation for :-

- Detailed information about integration of Vector iOS Map.
- REST APIs module is a custom module for developers to consume our RESTful APIs within their applications, easily, and without having to develop such 
  functionality from scratch.
- Detailed information related to how to integrate Mappls Widgets.

# [Map SDK](#Map-SDK)

`MapplsMap` is a SDK to display map, mark locations, enhance with custom data and even draw routes or other shapes on top.

## [Getting Started](#Getting-Started)

Mappls's Map SDK for iOS lets you easily add Mappls Map and web services to your own iOS app. Mappls's Map SDK for iOS supports iOS SDK 9.0 and above and Xcode 10.1 or later. You can have a look at the map and features you will get in your own app by using the Mappls's Maps app for iOS. The SDK handles map tiles download and their display along with a bunch of controls and native gestures.

## [Setup your Project](#Setup-your-Project)

#### Create a new project in Xcode.

To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter its repository URL. See [Adding Package Dependencies to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).

### [Dependencies](#Dependencies)

This library depends upon `MapplsAPICore`, `MapplsAPIKit`. All dependent libraries will be automatically.

- For iOS9 or later, make this change to your info.plist (Project target > info.plist > Add row and set keys `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`). As follows
    ```
    <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Your location is required</string>
    <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Your location is required</string>
    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Your location is required</string>
    ```
    Message should be appropriate, according to use of your application.

### [MapplsMap](#mapplsmap)

A class `MapplsMapAuthenticator` can be used to authorize the Map.

It is recommended to call this method before initilizing `MapplsMapView`.

Swift
```swift
MapplsMapAuthenticator.sharedManager().initializeSDKSession { isSucess, error in
  if let error = error {
  // Map cannot be initilize
    print("error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
  } else {
    // Map is authorized sucessfully.
  }
}
```

Objective - C

```swift
[[MapplsMapAuthenticator sharedManager] initializeSDKSession:^(BOOL isSuccess, NSError * _Nullable error) {
  if (isSuccess) {
    // Map is authorized sucessfully.          
  } else {
    // Map cannot be initilize
  }
}];

```

Note: Although authorization of Map is done internally on initilizing `MapplsMapView`, **Using this in advance will reduce map loading time**


## [Usage](#Usage)

## [Add a Mappls Map View](#Add-a-Mappls-Map-View)

Map View on view controller can be added either using interface builder or programmatically.

#### By Interface Builder 
In a storyboard, add a view to your View Controller. In the Identity inspector, change its class to `MapplsMapView`.  
**Note :-** Map style url need to be set at the time of load map  
  
#### By Programmatically 
To add map on view Controller create an instance of `MapplsMapView`. and add this to view of `ViewController`.

#### Objective C
```objectivec
#import
@interface ViewController () <MapplsMapViewDelegate>
@end
@implementation ViewController
```
#### Swift
```swift
import MapplsMap
class ViewController: UIViewController, MapplsMapViewDelegate {
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    let mapView = MapplsMapView(frame: view.bounds)
    mapView.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]
    view.addSubview(mapView)
  }
});
```

**Note** Also to handle app transport security exception add `NSAppTransportSecurity` in Info.plist of your project. As follows:
```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## [Map Interactions](#Map-Interactions)

### [Set Zoom Level](#Set-Zoom-Level)

Set zoom to 4 for country level display and 18 for house number display.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
[mapView setZoom:4];
```

#### Swift

```swift
mapView.zoomLevel = 4
```

### [Set Map Center](#Set-Map-Center)

To set Center of map reference code is below:

#### Objective C

```objectivec
[self.mapView setCenterCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.551438, 77.265119)];
```

#### Swift

```swift
mapView.centerCoordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.551438, 77.265119)
```

## [Map Features](#Map-Features)

### Current Location

To show user's current location on map, use property `.showsUserLocation.` and set its value to true.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
mapView.showsUserLocation = YES;
```

#### Swift

```swift
mapView.showsUserLocation = true
```

To get current location, use property `.userLocation.` its of type `MGLUserLocation` which contains `location` property. 

#### Swift

```swift
let userLocation: CLLocation = mapView.userLocation?.location
```

### Tracking Mode

To move map with user location change use property `userTrackingMode`. Its an enum property of type `.MGLUserTrackingMode.`. You can set any value from following:

- `followWithCourse`
- `followWithHeading`
- `none`

#### Objective C

```objectivec
self.mapView.userTrackingMode = MGLUserTrackingModeFollowWithCourse;
```

#### Swift

```swift
mapView.userTrackingMode = .followWithCourse
```

## [Map Events](#Map-Events)

The Map object should implement the methods of the `MapplsMapViewDelegate` protocol corresponding to the events you wish it to receive. This delegate can also be used to detect map overlays selection. Delegate handles gesture events, tap on annotation (marker) and map center coordinates.


### [Map Position Changes Events](#Map-Position-Changes-Events)
```
-(BOOL)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView shouldChangeFromCamera:(MGLMapCamera*)oldCamera toCamera:(MGLMapCamera *)newCamera;
-(BOOL)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView shouldChangeFromCamera:(MGLMapCamera*)oldCamera toCamera:(MGLMapCamera *)newCamera reason:(MGLCameraChangeReason)reason;
-(void)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView regionWillChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated;

-(void)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView regionDidChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated;`
-(void)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView regionDidChangeWithReason:(MGLCameraChangeReason)reason animated:(BOOL)animated;
```
### [Loading the Map Events](#Loading-the-Map-Events)

#### [-authorizationCompleted:withError:]()

This delegate function will be called whenever authorization process of map completed. It gives either sucess or error 

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapView:(MapplsMapView *)mapView authorizationCompleted:(BOOL)isSuccess withError:(nullable NSError *)error;
```

**Swift**
```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MapplsMapView, authorizationCompleted isSuccess: Bool, withError error: Error?) {
        
 }
```


#### [-mapViewWillStartLoadingMap:]()
Tells the delegate that the map view will begin to load.

This method is called whenever the map view starts loading, including when a new style has been set and the map must reload.

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapViewWillStartLoadingMap:(nonnull MGLMapView *)mapView;  
```

**Swift**
```swift
optional func mapViewWillStartLoadingMap(_ mapView: MGLMapView)
```

#### [-mapViewDidFinishLoadingMap:]()

Tells the delegate that the map view has finished loading.

This method is called whenever the map view finishes loading, either after the initial load or after a style change has forced a reload.

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapViewDidFinishLoadingMap:(nonnull MGLMapView *)mapView;
```

**Swift**
```swift
optional func mapViewDidFinishLoadingMap(_ mapView: MGLMapView)
```

#### [-mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:withError:]()

Tells the delegate that the map view was unable to load data needed for displaying the map.

This method may be called for a variety of reasons, including a network connection failure or a failure to fetch the style from the server. You can use the given error message to notify the user that map data is unavailable.

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:(nonnull MGLMapView *)mapView
                       withError:(nonnull NSError *)error;
```

**Swift**
```swift
optional func mapViewDidFailLoadingMap(_ mapView: MGLMapView, withError error: Error)
```


#### [-mapViewWillStartRenderingFrame:]()

Tells the delegate that the map view is about to redraw.

This method is called any time the map view needs to redraw due to a change in the viewpoint or style property transition. This method may be called very frequently. Therefore, your implementation of this method should be as lightweight as possible to avoid affecting performance.

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapViewWillStartRenderingFrame:(nonnull MGLMapView *)mapView;
```

**Swift**
```swift
optional func mapViewWillStartRenderingFrame(_ mapView: MGLMapView)
```

#### [-mapViewDidFinishRenderingFrame:fullyRendered:]()

Tells the delegate that the map view has just redrawn.

This method is called any time the map view needs to redraw due to a change in the viewpoint or style property transition. This method may be called very frequently. Therefore, your implementation of this method should be as lightweight as possible to avoid affecting performance.

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapViewDidFinishRenderingFrame:(nonnull MGLMapView *)mapView
                         fullyRendered:(BOOL)fullyRendered;
```

**Swift**
```swift
optional func mapViewDidFinishRenderingFrame(_ mapView: MGLMapView, fullyRendered: Bool)
```

#### [-mapViewDidBecomeIdle:]()

Tells the delegate that the map view is entering an idle state, and no more drawing will be necessary until new data is loaded or there is some interaction with the map.

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapViewDidBecomeIdle:(nonnull MGLMapView *)mapView;
```

**Swift**
```swift
optional func mapViewDidBecomeIdle(_ mapView: MGLMapView)
```

#### [-mapView:didFinishLoadingStyle:]()

Tells the delegate that the map has just finished loading a style.

This method is called during the initialization of the map view and after any subsequent loading of a new style.

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapView:(nonnull MGLMapView *)mapView
    didFinishLoadingStyle:(nonnull MGLStyle *)style;
```

**Swift**
```swift
optional func mapView(_ mapView: MGLMapView, didFinishLoading style: MGLStyle)
```

#### [-mapView:didTapPlaceWithMapplsPin:]()

This delegate function gives `Mappls Pin`.

This method is called on tap on map and gives either string value (Mappls Pin) or nil value (if no Mappls Pin found).

**Objective-C**
```objectivec
- (void)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView didTapPlaceWithMapplsPin:(NSString *)mapplsPin;
```

**Swift**
```swift
optional func mapView(_ mapView: MGLMapView, didTapPlaceWithMapplsPin mapplsPin: String?)
```

### [SDK Error Codes](#SDK-Error-Codes)

Map will fail with following error codes

- MAPS_SDK_KEY_MISSING=1; //when map sdk key is not passed
- REST_API_KEY_MISSING=2; //when rest api key is not passed
- ATLAS_CLIENT_ID_MISSING=3; //when atlas client id is not passed

## [Map Tap Events](#Map-Tap-Events)

### [Single Tap Gesture](#Single-Tap-Gesture)

To capture single tap on map events add a tap gesture to instance of `MapplsMapView`. Tapped CGPoint on map can be converted to CLLocationCoordinate object. Also if there is any mareker in tapped area that can also be retrieved. Code for reference to explain above features is below:

#### Objective C

```objectivec
UITapGestureRecognizer *singleTap = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc]
initWithTarget:self action:@selector(didTapPress:)];
[self.mapView addGestureRecognizer:singleTap];

-(void)didTapPress:(UILongPressGestureRecognizer *)gesture {
  if(UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded == gesture.state) {
    CGPoint touchPoint = [sender locationInView:self.mapView];

    // Convert tapped area point to a CLLocationCoordinate object
    CLLocationCoordinate2D location = [self.mapView convertPoint:touchPoint toCoordinateFromView:self.mapView;

    // Also existing annotation or features can be checked on tapped area point
    NSArray<id <MGLFeature>> * visibleFeatures = [self.mapView visibleFeaturesAtPoint: touchPoint];
    if (visibleFeatures.count > 0) {

    }
  }
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
let singleTap = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action:
 #selector(didTapMap(tap:)))
 mapView.addGestureRecognizer(singleTap)
 @objc func didTapMap(tap: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
 if tap.state == .ended {
    let point = tap.location(in: mapView)

    // Convert tapped area point to a CLLocationCoordinate object
    let coordinate = mapView.convert(point, toCoordinateFrom: mapView)

    // Also existing annotation or features can be checked on tapped area point
    let visibleFeatures = mapView.visibleFeatures(at: point)
    if visibleFeatures.count > 0 {

    }
  }
}
```

### [Long Tap Gesture](#Long-Tap-Gesture)

To capture long press on map events add a long press gesture to instance of `MapplsMapView`.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
UILongPressGestureRecognizer *longPress =  [[UILongPressGestureRecognizer
alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(didLongPress:)];
[longPress setMinimumPressDuration:1.0];

[self.mapView addGestureRecognizer:longPress];
-(void)didLongPress:(UILongPressGestureRecognizer *)gesture {
  if(UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded == gesture.state) {
    CGPoint touchPoint = [sender locationInView:self.mapView];

    // Convert tapped area point to a CLLocationCoordinate object
    CLLocationCoordinate2D location = [self.mapView convertPoint:touchPoint toCoordinateFromView:self.mapView;

    // Also existing annotation or features can be checked on tapped area point
    NSArray<id <MGLFeature>> * visibleFeatures = [self.mapView visibleFeaturesAtPoint: touchPoint];
    if (visibleFeatures.count > 0) {

    }
  }
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
let longPress = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action:
#selector(didLongPress(tap:)))
mapView.addGestureRecognizer(longPress)
@objc func didLongPress(tap: UILongPressGestureRecognizer) {
if tap.state == .ended {
    let point = tap.location(in: mapView)

    // Convert tapped area point to a CLLocationCoordinate object
    let coordinate = mapView.convert(point, toCoordinateFrom: mapView)

    // Also existing annotation or features can be checked on tapped area point
    let visibleFeatures = mapView.visibleFeatures(at: point)
    if visibleFeatures.count > 0 {

    }
  }
}
```

## [Map Overlays](#Map-Overlays)

### Add marker
To show an annotation on map create an instance of `MGLPointAnnotation` and add that object to instance of `MapplsMapView` using method `addAnnotation.`.

After creating instance of `MGLPointAnnotation`, set coordinate and title property values.

#### Objective C
```objectivec
MGLPointAnnotation *point = [[MGLPointAnnotation alloc] init];
point.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.550834, 77.268918);
point.title = @"Annotation";
[self.mapView addAnnotation:point];
```
#### Swift
```swift
var point = MGLPointAnnotation()
point.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.550834, longitude: 77.268918)
point.title = "Annotation"
mapView.addAnnotation(point)
```

### Remove marker

#### Objective C
```objectivec
[self.mapView removeAnnotation:point];
```
#### Swift
```swift
mapView.removeAnnotation(point)
```

### Custom Marker (Change Default Marker Icon)

To change image for default marker you can use delegate methods of protocol  
`MapplsMapViewDelegate`. 
Either you can override whole view of marker by using below method of delegate:
```
-(nullable MGLAnnotationView *)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(id <MGLAnnotation>)annotation;
```
or you can override image of marker by using below method of delegate:
```
-(nullable MGLAnnotationImage *)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView imageForAnnotation:(id <MGLAnnotation>)annotation;
```

### Show Info Window (Callout)

To enable info window on tap of marker return true from below delegate method:

```objectivec
- (BOOL)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView annotationCanShowCallout:(id <MGLAnnotation>)annotation;
```

### Custom Info Window(#Custom-Info-Window)

To change default callout view of annotation use delegate function of `MapplsMapViewDelegate.` protocol and return custom view of callout from that function.

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MGLMapView, calloutViewFor annotation:
MGLAnnotation) -> MGLCalloutView? {
return CustomCalloutView(representedObject: annotation)
}
```

To create custom callout view create a class inherited from `.MGLCalloutView.` and `.UIView.`. Override draw function of `UIView` to design your own callout view.

## [Polylines](#Polylines)

### Add a Polyline

To show a polyline on map create an instance of `MGLPolyline` and add that object to instance of `MGLMapView` using method `.addAnnotation.`.

To create instance of `MGLPolyline` an array of `CLLocationCoordinate2D` will be required so first create an array of `CLLocationCoordinate2D`.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinates[] = {
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.550834, 77.268918),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.551059, 77.268890),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.550938, 77.267641),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.551764, 77.267575),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.552068, 77.267599),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.553836, 77.267450),
};
NSUInteger numberOfCoordinates = sizeof(coordinates) / sizeof(CLLocationCoordinate2D);
MGLPolyline *polyline = [MGLPolyline polylineWithCoordinates:coordinates count:numberOfCoordinates];
[self.mapView addAnnotation:polyline];
```
#### Swift

```swift
var coordinates = [
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.550834, longitude: 77.268918),
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.551059, longitude: 77.268890),
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.550938, longitude: 77.267641),

CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.552068, longitude: 77.267599),
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.553836, longitude: 77.267450),
]
let polyline = MGLPolyline(coordinates: &coordinates, count: UInt(coordinates.count))
mapView.addAnnotation(polyline)
```

### [Remove a Polyline](#Remove-a-Polyline)

#### Objective C

```objectivec
[self.mapView removeAnnotation:polyline];
```

#### Swift

```swift
mapView.removeAnnotation(polyline)
```

### [Polyline Width](#Polyline-Width)

Line width in points can be set when rendering the outline of a polyline annotation. It cab be achieve by using delegate method `lineWidthForPolylineAnnotation`.

By default, the polyline is outlined with a line 3.0 points wide.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
- (CGFloat)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView lineWidthForPolylineAnnotation:(MGLPolyline *)annotation
{
  return 10.0;
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MGLMapView, lineWidthForPolylineAnnotation annotation: MGLPolyline) -> CGFloat {
  return 10.0
}
```

## [Polygons](#Polygons)

### [Add a Polygon](#Add-a-Polygon)

To show a polygon on map create an instance of `MGLPolygon` and add that object to instance of `MGLMapView` using method `.addAnnotation.`.

To create instance of `MGLPolygon` an array of `CLLocationCoordinate2D` will be required so first create an array of `CLLocationCoordinate2D`.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinates[] = {
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.550834, 77.268918),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.551059, 77.268890),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.550938, 77.267641),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.551764, 77.267575),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.552068, 77.267599),
CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.553836, 77.267450),
};
NSUInteger numberOfCoordinates = sizeof(coordinates) / sizeof(CLLocationCoordinate2D);
MGLPolygon *polygon = [MGLPolygon polygonWithCoordinates:coordinates count:numberOfCoordinates];//
[self.mapView addAnnotation:polygon];
```

#### Swift

```swift
var coordinates = [
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.550834, longitude: 77.268918),
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.551059, longitude: 77.268890),
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.550938, longitude: 77.267641),
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.551764, longitude: 77.267575),
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.552068, longitude: 77.267599),
CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.553836, longitude: 77.267450),
]
let polygon = MGLPolygon(coordinates: &coordinates, count: UInt(coordinates.count))
mapView.addAnnotation(polygon)
```


### [Remove a Polygon](#Remove-a-Polygon)

#### Objective C

```objectivec
[self.mapView removeAnnotation:polygon];
```

#### Swift

```swift
mapView.removeAnnotation(polygon)
```

## [Map Camera](#Map-Camera)

### [Fit Map Camera](#Fit-Map-Camera)

`showAnnotations` function sets the visible region so that the map displays the specified annotations.

#### Swift

```swift
mapView.showAnnotations(annotations, animated: true)
```

### [Create Camera For Shape](#Create-Camera-For-Shape)

A camera object that best fits the given shape with some additional padding on each side while looking in the specified direction can be retrieved using function `cameraThatFitsShape` of `MapplsMapView`.

After creating a camera object using above function it can be set to fit map visible area.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinates[] = {
  CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.550834, 77.268918),
  CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.551059, 77.268890),

  CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.552068, 77.267599),
  CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(28.553836, 77.267450),
};

NSUInteger numberOfCoordinates = sizeof(coordinates) / sizeof(CLLocationCoordinate2D);
MGLPolygon *polygon = [MGLPolygon polygonWithCoordinates:coordinates count:numberOfCoordinates];//
[self.mapView addAnnotation:polygon];
MGLMapCamera *shapeCam = [self.mapView cameraThatFitsShape:polygon direction:(0) edgePadding:UIEdgeInsetsMake(20, 20, 20, 20)];
[self.mapView setCamera:shapeCam];
```

#### Swift

```swift
var coordinates = [
  CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.550834, longitude: 77.268918),
  CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.551059, longitude: 77.268890),

]
let polyline = MGLPolyline(coordinates: &coordinates, count: UInt(coordinates.count))
let shapeCam = mapView.cameraThatFitsShape(polyline, direction: CLLocationDirection(0), edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets(top: 20, left: 20, bottom: 20, right: 20))
mapView.setCamera(shapeCam, animated: false)
```

## [Miscellaneous](#Miscellaneous)

### [Shape Stroke Color](#Shape-Stroke-Color)

Color of `polyline` and stroke color of `polygon` can be changed by using delegate method `strokeColorForShapeAnnotation`.

The default stroke color is the map view’s tint color.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
- (UIColor *)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView strokeColorForShapeAnnotation:(MGLShape *)annotation {
    return [UIColor redColor];
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MGLMapView, strokeColorForShapeAnnotation annotation: MGLShape) -> UIColor {
  return .red
}
```

### [Shape Fill Color](#Shape-Fill-Color)

Fill Color of `polygon` can be changed by using delegate method `fillColorForPolygonAnnotation`.

The default fill color is the map view’s tint color. 

#### Objective C

```objectivec
- (UIColor *)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView fillColorForPolygonAnnotation:(MGLPolygon *)annotation {
    return [UIColor redColor];
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MGLMapView, fillColorForPolygonAnnotation annotation: MGLPolygon) -> UIColor {
  return UIColor.red
}
```

### [Shape Opacity](#Shape-Opacity)

To change opacity of a shape i.e polyline or polygon, delegate method `alphaForShapeAnnotation` can be used.

It sets the opacity of an entire shape, inclusive of its stroke and fill.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
- (CGFloat)mapView:(MGLMapView *)mapView alphaForShapeAnnotation:(MGLShape *)annotation
{
  return 0.5;
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MGLMapView, alphaForShapeAnnotation annotation: MGLShape) -> CGFloat {
  return 0.5
}
```

### [Safety Status Strip](#Safety-Status-Strip)

A safety status strip can be show on map based on user's location. COVID-19 status will be shown on map currently, It will show whether user's location lies in a containment zone or not and conaintment zone info like Containment Zone Name, District etc. For more info about how to use go to [Safety Strip](https://github.com/mappls-api/mappls-ios-sdk/Mappls-Safety-Strip).

### [Cluster Based Authentication](#Cluster-Based-Authentication)

Map SDK can be configured such that it can work only for specified unique identifier of a device and will show an error accordingly.

#### [Set Cluster Device](#Set-Cluster-Device)

Cluster Identifier can be set and retrieve using singelton class `MapplsAccountManager` which is part of Map SDK's dependency `MapplsAPICore`.

Below is code for reference to set and get cluster identifier.

#### Objective C

```objectivec
// Set Cluster Identifier
[MapplsAccountManager setClusterId:@"YOUR_CLUSTER_DEVICE_IDENTIFIER"];

// Get Cluster Identifier
NSString * clusterId = [MapplsAccountManager clusterId];
```

#### Swift

```swift
// Set Cluster Identifier
MapplsAccountManager.setClusterId("YOUR_CLUSTER_DEVICE_IDENTIFIER")

// Get Cluster Identifier
let clusterId = MapplsAccountManager.clusterId()
```

### [Create Map View](#Create-MAPPLS-Map-View)

1. In your project, add new SwiftUI View and name it MapView.swift
2. In order to use native UIKit views in `SwiftUI` view, you must use [UIViewRepresentable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable) wrapper. The instance of custom type which adopts UIViewRepresentable protocol is responsible for creation and management a UIView object in your SwiftUI interface.
    ```
    struct MapView: UIViewRepresentable {
        ...
    }
    ```
3. The UIViewRepresentable requires to implement makeUIViewController(context:) method that creates the instance of with the desired UIKit view. Add the following code to create map view instance
    ```
    private let mapView: MapplsMapView = MapplsMapView(frame: .zero)

    func makeUIView(context: UIViewRepresentableContext<MapView>) -> MapplsMapView {
        mapView.delegate = context.coordinator
        return mapView
    }
    ```
4. The UIViewRepresentable view also requires to implement updateUIView(_:context:) which is used to configure the newly created instance. To show map only We dont need to configure anything so we will keep it empty.
    ```
    func updateUIView(_ uiView: MapplsMapView, context: UIViewRepresentableContext<MapView>) {}
    ```

To add map annoations at design time add an `annotations` property in `MapView` struct as below:

```
@Binding var annotations: [MGLPointAnnotation]
```

Use below code to add marker at design time by setting annotations property.
```
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State var annotations: [MGLPointAnnotation] = [
        MGLPointAnnotation(title: "MAPPLS", coordinate: .init(latitude: 28.550679, longitude: 77.268949))
    ]
    
    var body: some View {
        MapView(annotations: $annotations).centerCoordinate(.init(latitude: 28.550679, longitude: 77.268949)).zoomLevel(16)
    }
}
```

### [Respond To Map Events](#Respond-To-Map-Events)

In order to to respond to map events, for example perform an action after MapView initialization finished. In SwiftUI, a Coordinator can be used with delegates, data sources, and user events. The UIViewRepresentable protocol defines makeCoordinator() method which creates coordinator instance. Add the following code to declare coordinator class:

```
class Coordinator: NSObject, MGLMapViewDelegate {
    var control: MapView

    init(_ control: MapView) {
        self.control = control
    }

    func mapView(_ mapView: MGLMapView, didFinishLoading style: MGLStyle) {
        // write your custom code which will be executed
        // after map's style has been loaded
    }
}
```

And then add the following method to the SwiftUI view:

```
func makeCoordinator() -> MapView.Coordinator {
    Coordinator(self)
}
```

And finally set the reference coordinator on Mappls map view.

```
mapView.delegate = context.coordinator
```
